# Twitter

This is a twitter clone project. Twitter is a very famous conversational social platform where users are eager to engage with the content they like, and not only reshare it but add their thoughts on the matter as well. I have tried to build some functionalities Like feed, authorization, UI, Create Post with image, follow, unfollow. I will add more functionalities. 



## Features


**User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in securely.

**Create Post**: Users can write a post and upload image. 

**Follow and Unfollow**: User can follow someone and Unfollow someone. 

**Feed**: User can see recommended feed. 

**User profile**: User can see other user profile.
